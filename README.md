# Mobile Listing Auto-Updater (Python)

A Python-based **automation tool** designed to manage and update mobile phone listings on a web platform through browser interaction.

This project demonstrates practical experience in **web automation**, **DOM interaction**, and **time-based task execution** using Python.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The purpose of this tool is to automate repetitive listing management tasks that are typically performed manually through a web interface.

The script:
- Logs into a user account
- Navigates through multiple pages of listings
- Selects listings one by one
- Performs update actions on each item
- Repeats the process at randomized time intervals

The goal is to keep listings active and up to date without continuous manual interaction.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Automated Login Flow**
  - Programmatic authentication through the website’s login form
  - Session handling within the automation process

- **DOM-Based Interaction**
  - Locates page elements dynamically
  - Performs actions such as clicking, selecting, and submitting forms
  - Handles pagination to iterate through multiple listing pages

- **Bulk Listing Update**
  - Iterates through all available mobile listings
  - Updates each listing individually in sequence

- **Randomized Execution Intervals**
  - Runs update cycles at random intervals between **5 to 15 minutes**
  - Designed to simulate human-like interaction patterns

- **Fully Scripted Workflow**
  - End-to-end automation without manual intervention
  - Suitable for long-running background execution

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- Browser automation using Python
- Dynamic element detection and interaction
- Time-based task scheduling with randomized delays
- Robust looping over paginated content
- Practical handling of real-world web UI behavior

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Automation:** Browser-based automation (e.g. Selenium / similar tooling)  
- **Interaction:** DOM element selection and event triggering  
- **Timing & Control:** Python standard libraries for scheduling and delays  

---

The script is structured to keep authentication, navigation, and update logic clearly separated for maintainability.

---

## ▶️ How It Works (High-Level)

1. Authenticate into the user account
2. Navigate to the listings management section
3. Loop through all available pages
4. For each listing:
   - Select the item
   - Perform the update action
5. Wait for a randomized delay
6. Repeat the process automatically

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

- Ability to automate real operational workflows
- Experience with browser-level web automation
- Understanding of DOM-based interaction
- Handling timing, delays, and execution cycles
- Writing maintainable Python scripts for real usage
